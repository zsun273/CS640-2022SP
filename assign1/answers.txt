Q2: 
My answer/prediction:
The latency between h1 and h4 would be the sum of latency of Link L1, L2 and L3.
The throughput between h1 and h4 would be the minimum throughput of Link L1, L2 and L3.

The average RTT is:      . And the sum of RTT of L1, L2, L3 is:     .
The measured throughput is, which is very close to   .
My prediction is mostly correct.



Q3:
When multiple hosts connected to s1 want to talk to hosts connected to s4 simultaneously:
Two pairs: I expect latency to be larger than what we have for one pair, and throughput be smaller than what we have for one pair.
Three pairs: I expect latency to be larger than what we have for two pairs, and throughput be smaller than what we have for two pairs.
